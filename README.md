# sn-utils-slash-cmds

Got annoyed the All menu shortcut didn't work on Firefox.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have the [SN Utils extension](https://snutils.com) installed.
2. Navigate to a Service Now instance browser window (may require a refresh).
3. Open the plugin and navigate to the Settings tab.
4. Go to the Slash Commands section, open the editor by double-clicking and copy/paste the contents of `export.json`.
